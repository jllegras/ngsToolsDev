WISH LIST

Major:

- Matteo+?: generalize input from SAMtools or Beagle?

Minor:

- Matteo: nicer comments and checks for input files

- Matteo: implement gimmeFST in ngsFST; basically this computes FST from KNOWN genotypes after running ngsSim (it is very specific but it could be useful);

- Matteo: add perl/python/bash script to compute multisite FST into a file that it will be taken as first guess of FST (so far only R script);

- Filipe: add R script to plot PCA from covariance matrix;
