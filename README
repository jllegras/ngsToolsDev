Set of programs/scripts to analyze NGS data for population genetics analyses.

###

ngsFST

compile: g++ ...

Program to estimate FST from NGS data. It computes expected genetic variance components and estimate FST from those.
In input it receives posterior probabilities of sample allele frequencies (from angsd0.204 and sfstools) for each population. It may receive also a 2D-SFS as a prior and in this case in gets in input posterior probabilities with uniform prior (angsd with -realSFS 1 only). Additionally it can use a corrected product of marginal spectra as prior. In this case it receives in input posterior probabilities of sample allele frequencies (from angsd0.204 and sfstools) and also marginal SFS.

Run with no arguments for help.

###

ngsCovar

compile:

Program to compute the expected sample covariance matrix from genotype posterior probabilities. It receives in input genotype posterior probabilities (from angsd2.04 -doGeno 64). It can receive in input also posterior probabilities of sample allele frequencies (from angsd0.204 and sfstools) for computing the probability of each site to be variant.

Run with no arguments for help.

###

nsgSim

compile:

Program to simulate NGS data for up to 3 populations setting an inbreeding coefficient or a FST. It output true genotypes, reads and genotype likelihoods.

Run with no arguments for help.

###

get2DSFS

compile:

Program to estimate 2D-SFS from posterior probabilities of sample allele frequencies (from angsd0.204 and sfstools).

Run with no arguments for help.

###

getMultiFST.R

This script converts the output of ngsFST and compute multiple-site FST and rewrite the file with this new values of FST (to be used as -firstfile)
